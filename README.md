# React Tic Tac Toe

A functional implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using **React**. This project showcases component-driven design, use of React Hooks (`useState`), and clean separation of UI and logic layers.

## Objective

To build an interactive 2-player Tic Tac Toe game using modern React practices, emphasizing state management and event handling in a functional component architecture.

## Tech Stack

- **React** – Core library for UI rendering
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Application logic
- **CSS** – Basic styling and layout
- **Node.js + npm** – Dependency management and local dev server

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

- Functional components and composition
- State management using `useState`
- Conditional rendering and JSX
- Lifting state up to manage game status
- Stateless presentational components (cells)
- Basic win-condition algorithm using array evaluation
